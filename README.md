# Exercise: JavaScript Array/Function Practice
In this exercise, you will practice implementing functions and manipulating arrays through a series of small function implementations.

## Instructions
An `index.html` file is included which includes the JavaScript in `js/app.js`. When `index.html` is loaded, the included JavaScript file will execute.

Implement each of the 3 empty function declarations in `js/app.js` so that they behave as and return what is described in the comments above each respectively.

To test out your implementation, console log the results of each function call with test scenarios at the top of `app.js` (comments indicate where to place function calls/output).

Note that you will need to open up Chrome Dev Tools to see your output, as you will be logging everything to the console.

This is not a graded assignment. We will go over my implementations on Tuesday.
